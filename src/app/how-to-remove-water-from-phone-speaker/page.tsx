                    <p>
                        Dropping your phone in water is a heart-stopping moment. Even with modern "water-resistant" ratings (like IP68),
                        water can still get trapped in the speaker grills, leading to distorted, muffled, or crackling sound.
                        Understanding how to remove water from phone speakers correctly is crucial to prevent long-term damage.

                    <h2>1. Immediate Action Steps</h2>
                    <p>
                        If your phone just got wet, follow these steps immediately:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Power off your device if it&apos;s not water-resistant.</li>
                        <li>Wipe the exterior thoroughly with a lint-free cloth.</li>
                        <li>Remove any case or screen protector that might be holding moisture.</li>
                        <li>Do NOT use a hairdryer or compressed air (this can push water deeper).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. The Physics of Sound Wave Water Ejection</h2>
                    <p>
                        The most effective non-invasive method for removing water is using physics. Our <strong>SpeakerFix Pro</strong> tool uses
                        specific low-frequency sound waves (around 165Hz to 200Hz) that create a mechanical vibration. These vibrations
                        disrupt the surface tension of the water droplets inside the speaker chamber, literally shaking them out.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. Why Rice is a Myth</h2>
                    <p>
                        For years, the "put it in rice" method was popular. However, most tech experts and manufacturers now advise against it.
                        Rice can introduce dust, starch, and small particles into your phone&apos;s ports. Instead, use silica gel packets or
                        simply leave the phone in an area with good airflow.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Step-by-Step Ejection Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        To use our tool effectively:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Turn your phone volume to 100%.</li>
                        <li>Place the phone on a flat surface with the speaker grill facing down.</li>
                        <li>Visit the <a href="/">SpeakerFix Pro homepage</a> and select &apos;Water Eject&apos; mode.</li>
                        <li>Run the sound for at least 60 seconds. You may see small droplets appearing on the surface.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>5. What to Do if Sound is Still Muffled</h2>
                    <p>
                        If after several cycles the sound is still not clear, you may have debris or minerals left behind.
                        Try the &apos;Sweep Mode&apos; on our tool to clear finer particles. If the problem persists for more than 24 hours,
                        it might be time to visit a professional repair shop as internal corrosion could be starting.

                { q: "Can sound really eject water from a phone?", a: "Yes. Sound waves at specific frequencies create vibrations that can push water out of the speaker grill. This is the same logic used by the Apple Watch 'Water Lock' feature." },
