                        iPhone speakers are known for their clarity, but they are also magnets for dust, lint, and moisture.
                        If your iPhone 13, 14, or 15 sounds muffled, don&apos;t panic. In 90% of cases, it is a surface-level issue
                        that can be fixed in minutes without taking the phone apart.

                    <h2>Common Causes of Muffled iPhone Sound</h2>
                    <p>
                        Understanding <em>why</em> your iPhone sounds quiet is the first step:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gunk Accumulation:</strong> Makeup, earwax, and pocket lint clog the fine mesh.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Trapped:</strong> After a splash, water blocks the sound waves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Software Glitches:</strong> Occasionally, the OS thinks headphones are plugged in.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Best Fixes for iPhone Speakers</h2>

                    <h3>1. Use the 'Water Eject' Sound Frequency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Apple actually includes a 'Water Lock' feature on Apple Watches that uses a specific tone to eject water.
                        While the iPhone doesn&apos;t have this built-in, you can use our <a href="/">SpeakerFix Pro tool</a> to achieve the same result.
                        Select the 'Water Mode' and let the vibrations do the work.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Brush the Mesh Gently</h3>
                    <p>
                        Use a soft-bristled toothbrush (dry) to gently scrub the speaker grills at the bottom.
                        Tilt the phone so gravity helps the debris fall out rather than pushing it further in.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Check Accessibility Settings</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes the 'Mono Audio' or 'Balance' settings get changed by accident.
                        Go to <em>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio/Visual</em> and ensure the balance is centered.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To keep your iPhone sounding new:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clean your speaker grills once a month.</li>
                        <li>Avoid using your phone in very humid environments like the shower.</li>
                        <li>Use a case that has 'front-firing' speaker redirects to protect the mesh.</li>
                    </ul>
                </>

                { q: "Is the iPhone 15 waterproof?", a: "It is water-resistant (IP68), meaning it can survive submersion, but the speakers will still sound muffled until they are dried out." },
